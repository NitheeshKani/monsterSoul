## Project Overview

This project is a Java-based application that demonstrates the understanding of table relationships and querying in a database. The project is built using Spring Boot and utilizes JPA (Java Persistence API) for database interactions.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how table relationships work in a database. I learned how to design and implement various types of relationships, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. I also learned how to optimize database queries to improve performance.

## What it holds/function

Monster Dash is an innovative hybrid between monster capture and endless runner genres. Think Subway Surfers meets PokÃ©monâ€”with a twist. The player selects a level and is thrown into a dynamic run filled with real-time enemy attacks and obstacles. Survive, strike, and stealâ€”each run is a chance to grow stronger or lose hard-earned abilities.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features:

* Dynamic Combat Runs:
Battles unfold in endless runner-style gameplay where players dodge attacks (obstacles) and counter with their own chosen moves.

* Skill Capture System:
Defeat a monster to permanently absorb one of its moves. Choose wiselyâ€”these skills stack and evolve your playstyle.

* High Stakes Survival:
Lose all your life? You'll respawn, but at a costâ€”one of your acquired skills disappears, keeping the tension high and progress meaningful.

* Level-Based Encounters:
Each level brings a new, randomly selected monster encounter, making every run feel unique.

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack:

* Spring Boot (Backend):
Handles user progression, skill management, and monster data logic through a clean RESTful API.

* PostgreSQL (Database):
Stores user profiles, skill sets, monster metadata, level progression, and encounter history with efficient relational modeling.
